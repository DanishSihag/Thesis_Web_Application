Thesis Project focusing on the development of a web application for grocery e-commerce shopping.
The web-application was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end section and NodeJS along with JavaScript for the back-end and server-side part.
Regarding the storage of items, MySQL database was used via XAMPP software, which was also used for generating Apache web server for the corresponding web page output.
The products in database were inserted and handled using the MySQL administration tool - phpMyAdmin.
To make my web application fully responsive, the popular CSS framework, Bootstrap(v5.2.2) was also used. This was done so that the website does not break and avoids visual clutter when the window size is shrunk.
For reference of all individual items, the ‘myscript.js’ file can be checked, which has the dummy data for all products. It should be noted that the actual products were added in the database and not inside the JavaScript file.
During the development of the project, normal HTML files were used to monitor the progress on my local machine for rendering the web-pages.
After all the html files were completed, ’ejs’(Embedded JavaScript Templating) extension files were made, containing the same content of the HTML files, so that they could run on the localhost server with the specified port.
For using the localhost server, ExpressJS was used to create a session.
